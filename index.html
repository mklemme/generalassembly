I hope you don't notice, but I am filling up this area so it looks nice. I could not figure out how to get my slider to restart with the method I used. Much disappoint.</p>

    			<h2>Coder &amp; Pixel Pusher</h2>
    			<p>I began coding in 3rd grade. Building and hacking away on creating a custom Neopets profile page, which worked similarly to how Myspace allowed customizations - 
    				html tags to full blown html overlays. </p>
    			<p>I taught myself html just as divs started to replace table based designs. To create the actual designs, I would install trial versions of graphics programs. At the 
    				end of the trial, I'd move on to the next. When I ran out of programs to install, I would reformat my computer and the whole thing over again. Since I had my own webserver,
    				I was able to download numerous open source projects from <a href="http://hotscripts.com">Hotscripts.com</a>. Many projects required a more up to date tech stack than my
    				host provided, so I would regularly contact the system administrator and tell what I needed - the latest version of PHP, a new Apache update, etc. I persistent to the point
    				of being annoying.
    			</p>
    			<p>At that time, I learned about Google's Adsense program. All I had to do was install this snippet of code and I could earn revenue off my site? What? 15 year old me was dreaming big. I
    				installed the script and waited to see how much I could make off a site only I was visiting. Turns out the amount was somewhere in the 2 dollar range. Naturally, I created a refresh 
    				script to amp up the view count and let it loose, resulting in the ban of my account. I was in the 6th grade.</p>
    			<p>My technical career stalled until I took a digital graphics class in my junior year of high school. Like running into an ex, I remembered what inspired me to learn how to program at
    				an early age. I was better than my classmen at manipulating pixels, so much so that my teacher made me help the people around me. I just taught them shortcuts in Photoshop - mainly using freebies in their projects.
    				 I started going to conferences again, both business and technology alike. I attended Google I/O. Seeing all these geeky entrepreneurs made me want to build something of my own - something that could
    				 be my legacy. I came up with an idea for a way to monitor your water usage, since so much emphasis was on the electrical smart meter. I thought of devices that would be installed throughout the house,
    				 allowing homeowners to see in realtime, what their usage was down to the individual facets. I went to green technology conferences where I rubbed elbows with c-level executives from solar and clean energy companies.
    				 I told them about my idea, my vision for a self-aware world, and for a way that people could give back automagically through saving on utilities. They loved it. Sadly, I became disenfrancished by learning how PG&amp;E closed off their 
    				 meters, the lack of plans for smart water meters, and my inability to transform my idea from static mockups into a functioning application.</p>
    			<p>Still wanting to retain my connection to the tech scene in the bay area, I dove into my other passion: User experience and user interface design. With my mom's background in human computer interaction,
    				I grew up learning about how people use computers. Eventually that lead to more ideas for how computers could bridge the gap in so many verticals. For school, I conducted a year long research project 
    				into using technology in the classroom setting. My results were disheartening. Many of the programs assumed computers were just a digital form of books, and not a different platform for content consumption. Again, I saw
    				opprotunities for a new platform.</p>
    				<p>Enter the Sprk.Platform</p>
    				<p>Part of the reason for my application to the General Assembly program is to build Sprk. Sprk is an application framework for all my ideas and projects, starting with fitness. Imagine all the 
    					knowledge of a personal trainer quantified into a web application and made available for free. Users could find new workout, get tips based on their goals, see if their supplement stack has any conflicts,
    					get expert advice - all from an algorithm. The same process can be applied to education. A global private tutor that serves content based on the learning styles of the user and can test against subject weaknesses. It's already
    					being done by applications like Rosetta stone and Duolingo.</p>
